# Static Frame Solution for Warplet Traders

## A Different Approach: No API Required

After repeated issues with the API function in Vercel, I've implemented a completely different approach that doesn't require any API at all. This solution uses only static HTML files and direct button actions.

## How This Works

Instead of using a `post_url` to send requests to an API endpoint, we're using:

1. Static HTML files with direct navigation between them
2. Button actions set to `link` instead of the default `post`
3. Explicit `target` URLs for each button

This approach completely eliminates the need for any server-side code, avoiding the 500 errors we were seeing with the API function.

## Files Included

1. `public/static-frame.html` - The main entry point
2. `public/static-24h.html` - Shows 24-hour data
3. `public/static-7d.html` - Shows 7-day data
4. `public/about.html` - Information about the project

## How to Use

Simply deploy these files to Vercel. Since they're static HTML files, they will be served directly without involving any serverless functions, ensuring they work reliably.

The main entry point is: `https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/static-frame.html`

## Features

This static solution includes:
- Direct navigation between different views
- Sharing functionality via the Warpcast composer
- Nicely formatted trader information
- About page with project information

## Limitations

Since this is a static approach, it doesn't include:
- Real-time data updates
- User-specific "Check My Follows" functionality
- Dynamic content generation

## Why This Approach Works

When API functions fail, a static approach is very reliable because:
1. It doesn't require any server-side code execution
2. It's not subject to function timeouts or memory limits
3. It doesn't depend on environment variables or API tokens
4. It's served directly from Vercel's edge network

## Next Steps

Once this static solution is working reliably, we can:
1. Explore why the API function is failing in Vercel
2. Gradually add back dynamic functionality 
3. Add the "Check My Follows" feature when the basic functionality is stable

This approach prioritizes having a working frame over maintaining all of the desired functionality.
