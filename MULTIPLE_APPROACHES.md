# Multiple Approaches to Fix Vercel API 500 Errors

We've created several different approaches to work around the Vercel API 500 errors you're experiencing. Each approach uses a different technique that might work better for your specific situation.

## Approach 1: Simplified API (api/index.js)
- Ultra-minimal API that just returns plain text
- No dependencies, no logic, just a simple string response
- Test URL: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/api

## Approach 2: Edge Function (api/edge.js)
- Uses Vercel's Edge Runtime instead of Serverless Functions
- More limited but more reliable execution environment
- Frame to test: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/edge-frame.html
- API URL: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/api/edge

## Approach 3: Direct HTML Handler (api/direct-html.js)
- Pure HTML generation with no external dependencies
- Simple button handling with fallback for errors
- Frame to test: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/direct-html-frame.html
- API URL: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/api/direct-html

## Approach 4: All Routes Combined (api/all-routes.js)
- Single API file that handles multiple routes
- Reduces the number of serverless functions deployed
- Frame to test: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/all-routes-frame.html
- API URL: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/api/all-routes

## Approach 5: Static Frame Navigation (No API)
- Static HTML files with direct navigation links
- No API involved but loses in-place refresh
- Start URL: https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/static-frame.html

## Next Steps

1. Deploy all these approaches to Vercel
2. Test each approach to see which one works reliably
3. Once you find a working approach, expand it to include the real functionality (real data, "Check My Follows" button, etc.)

Remember to check your Vercel environment variables to ensure NEYNAR_API_KEY and DUNE_API_KEY are configured correctly.
