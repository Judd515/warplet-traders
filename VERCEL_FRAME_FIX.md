# Fixing Frame Communication Error in Vercel Deployment

## The Issue

Warpcast frames with the error message:
> "Frame error: Unknown error communicating with the frame server"

This occurs when Warpcast tries to communicate with your API endpoint but something goes wrong in the request/response cycle.

## Key Changes to Fix This Issue

1. **External Images**: Using hosted images on Imgur instead of base64-encoded SVGs
2. **Simplified API Path**: Using `/api` (root endpoint) instead of longer paths
3. **Error-Resistant Code**: Adding try/catch blocks around parsing logic
4. **Better Logging**: Improved server-side logging for debugging

## Deployment Steps

### 1. What to Deploy

- `public/clean-frame.html` - Updated entry page with external image 
- `api/index.js` - Ultra-minimal API handler

### 2. How to Deploy to Vercel

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Log into your Vercel account and deploy from your repository
3. Use these settings:
   - Framework preset: **Other**
   - Output directory: **public**
   - No build command needed

### 3. Verifying It Works

After deployment:
1. Visit your frame URL: `https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/clean-frame.html` 
2. Check that the image loads
3. Click the buttons to see if they work without errors
4. Check Vercel Function logs for any errors

## Why This Should Work

This approach:
1. Uses a proven pattern that's known to work with Warpcast frames
2. Simplifies the communication between Warpcast and your API
3. Uses external images which eliminate potential SVG parsing issues
4. Uses a direct API path which is easier for the frame to reach

## If You Still Have Issues

If you still encounter the error:
1. Check Vercel Function logs for details
2. Verify your API endpoint is accessible with curl:
   ```
   curl -X POST https://warplet-traders.vercel.app/api -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"untrustedData":{"buttonIndex":1}}'
   ```
3. Try with a completely new Vercel project using just these minimal files
