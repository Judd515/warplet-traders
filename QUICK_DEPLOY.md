# Quick Deployment Guide for Warplet Traders

## Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/warplet-traders.git
cd warplet-traders
```

## Step 2: Deploy on Vercel
1. Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account if you don't have one
2. From the Vercel dashboard, click "Add New" > "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Set the following environment variables:
   - `NEYNAR_API_KEY`: Your Neynar API key
   - `DUNE_API_KEY`: Your Dune Analytics API key
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

## Step 3: Update Domain References
After deploying, update all references to "warplet-traders.vercel.app" in the code to your own Vercel domain.

## Step 4: Test Your Deployment
1. Once deployed, visit `https://your-domain.vercel.app` to see all the frame options
2. Try the recommended redirect-frame.html by visiting `https://your-domain.vercel.app/redirect-frame.html`
3. Cast this URL on Warpcast to test how the frame appears

## Step 5: Share on Warpcast
Share your frame on Warpcast with a message like:
```
Check out my Top Warplet Traders app! See which of your follows are crushing it on BASE ðŸ“Š

https://your-domain.vercel.app/redirect-frame.html
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure your API keys are set correctly in Vercel
- Try using the simpler frames first (super-minimal.html, static.html)
- Check for any CORS issues in your browser console
- Verify that your domain is correctly set in all post_url references
