# Static Solution for Warplet Traders

## Current Solution

We've created a static frame-based solution that avoids using API endpoints since they're currently failing with 500 errors in Vercel. This approach uses direct HTML files with link-based navigation instead of post_url-based API interactions.

### What Works:
- Frame renders correctly in Warpcast
- All buttons function to show data
- Data displays correctly in each view
- Share functionality works to share results

### Limitations:
- Buttons open new pages instead of refreshing data in-place
- No "Check My Follows" functionality since it requires API access
- No real-time data updates from Dune Analytics/Neynar

## Future Enhancements

Once we resolve the API issues, we can implement these enhancements:

### 1. In-Frame Data Loading
When the API endpoints work, we can switch back to the post_url approach where data refreshes within the same frame without opening new pages.

### 2. "Check My Follows" Feature
This personalized feature would analyze the follows of the user interacting with the frame and show top traders among those accounts.

### 3. Dynamic Image Generation
Instead of using static badges, we can create dynamic SVG images that show actual trader data directly in the frame image.

### 4. Real-Time Data Updates
Connect to Dune Analytics and Neynar APIs to fetch real-time trading data rather than using static data.

## Steps to Fix API Issues

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   Make sure NEYNAR_API_KEY and DUNE_API_KEY are set in your Vercel project.

2. **Review Vercel Logs**
   Check the function logs in Vercel to see the specific error causing the 500 status.

3. **Try Alternative API Approaches**
   - Test the pages/api format we created
   - Try the edge function approach
   - Test the all-routes approach

4. **Consider Vercel Pro Upgrade**
   If all else fails, you might need to upgrade from the Hobby plan to resolve function timeout issues.

## How to Integrate Real Data

Once the API endpoints are working:

1. **Replace Static HTML**
   Update the API handlers to fetch real data from Dune and Neynar

2. **Update API Response Format**
   Make sure the API returns proper frame HTML with real data

3. **Implement the "Check My Follows" Button**
   Use the untrustedData.fid from the frame request to check the user's follows

4. **Generate Dynamic SVG Images**
   Create data visualizations for the frame images based on real trader data
